Here is my repository containing my project report, code file, and final data file for the Advanced Methods of Data Analysis Course for the Advanced Data Science and Predictive Analytics Certificate Program provided by York University School of Continuing Studies on [York University Website](https://continue.yorku.ca/certificates/big-data-analytics-program/certificate-in-advanced-data-science-and-predictive-analytics/).

# About Project
Movie4You is an app founded in May 2015 with headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, where users can watch movies and TV shows online or stream to their smart TV, PC, mobile, and tablet. They last updated their movie database in July 2017, where a wide selection of movies and TV shows can be found across several genres. In the first year of operation, they had 600,000 paid subscribers, but at the end of the second year, they only had 400,000 paid subscribers. The marketing department of Movie4You has determined that although having an extensive database of movies and TV shows, users do not know what they should watch next and eventually end their subscriptions. Group 1 has been retained to help Movie4You develop a recommendation system using the MovieLens Dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) to predict movies for users based on their preferences and deploy it in a user-friendly interface.
